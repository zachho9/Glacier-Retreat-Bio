These were all heard in an area spanning about 200 metres once I had left the level part of the track and was making my way up the steep slope towards the lake. They were in an alpine herb field with a lot of snow tussock and a few rocks around. Several were calling as I made my way up and one broke cover and was seen bobbing on a nearby rock briefly. There was light rain falling during the time here. I have seen them a little lower down before but not in this area before. I have been in this area 5-6 times before.

The sighting was below the top of the old tramway beside the kiosk.  Bright sunny morning, light wind. Looking down on 2 rock wren at a distance of approximately 25m.  Observer had seen rock wren before but a long time ago but identified the 2 birds by their bobbing behaviour and location standing on top of a rock amongst other rocks and low scrub. They watched the birds for 5 minutes before the birds disappeared further below them out of sight and under more rocks. No calls were heard but observers didn't feel they would have recognised calls."

Rock Wren exhibited usual species behaviour, sighted bobbing and foraging on moss covered rocks below the walking track, c.15metres above the river bank. Eliminated Rifleman species as possible identification due to this wrens distinctly taller/upright stance, longer legs, strongly defined white supercilium, vivid yellow flanks & rump, overall size, behaviour hopping /foraging on the rocks.

It was some time of anticipation before James shouted up the slope to say he had one!--Beautiful little bird with an upright, majestic posture standing tall at  tops of large boulders on long pink (unbanded) legs with a virtually absent tail. Looked left and right as it investigated us, bobbing up and down while doing teeny tiny flaps. A big hop and it would look down to pick an insect before looking back at us again, then moving on to the next rock. Every now and again it would stop to lean back and triumphantly peep a teeny tiny peep. This bird covered at least a hundred meters, foraging between rocks and in tiny bushes, with the two of us quietly behind it. --Pale grey brown crown contrasting with a neat whitish supercilium atop a slightly darker and very faint eyeline. Creamy yellow buff underparts with brighter yellow highlights along the flanks. Blackish primary coverts stood out on an otherwise dull greenish wing. Mantle a pale olive brown.--Continuing up the slope we encountered two more colour-banded birds. The first of which was banded orange/white on left blue/alloy on right and obviously unwell with a broken right leg. This bird stood apart from the first with a sharper defined, rich brown crown. The second of these birds, presumably a male, was banded orange/purple, blue/alloy and had a more greenish crown with a more prominent dark patch around the eye."
